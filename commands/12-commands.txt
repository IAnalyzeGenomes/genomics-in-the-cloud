About:

This is a simple text file that contains the commands present in
chapter 5.  We created this file to prevent readers from having
to type out commands from our book.  This is not a stand-alone
tutorial, you'll want to follow along in the chapter to get
context on what these commands do.

Conventions:

Commands you run on your cloud shell or VM begin with "$".
Commands you run within a Docker container begin with "#".
Commands lacking an initial "$" or "#" are typically
provided for illustration purposes and we don't expect you
to run them.

Commands:

gs://genomics-in-the-cloud/v1/scripts/install_GATK_4130_with_igv.sh
