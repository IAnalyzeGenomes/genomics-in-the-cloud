About:

This is a simple text file that contains the commands present in
chapter 5.  We created this file to prevent readers from having
to type out commands from our book.  This is not a stand-alone
tutorial, you'll want to follow along in the chapter to get
context on what these commands do.

Conventions:

Commands you run on your cloud shell or VM begin with "$".
Commands you run within a Docker container begin with "#".
Commands lacking an initial "$" or "#" are typically
provided for illustration purposes and we don't expect you
to run them.

Commands:

$ export CASE1=~/book/code/workflows/mystery-1

$ mkdir ~/sandbox-9

$ cat ~/sandbox-9/haplotypecaller-gvcf-gatk4.dot
$ java -jar $BIN/womtool-48.jar graph $CASE1/haplotypecaller-gvcf-gatk4.wdl \
    > ~/sandbox-9/haplotypecaller-gvcf-gatk4.dot

$ export CASE2=~/book/code/workflows/mystery-2

$ java -jar $BIN/womtool-48.jar graph $CASE2/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.wdl  \
    > ~/sandbox-9/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.dot

$ cat ~/sandbox-9/WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.dot

$ java -jar $BIN/womtool-48.jar graph $CASE2/tasks/VariantCalling.wdl \
